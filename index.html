												<h3>Layoff's Data Cleaning and EDA in MySQL</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In This Project, I worked with a large dataset containing information on company layoffs, focusing on cleaning and transforming the raw data in MySQL. I addressed issues such as missing values, inconsistencies to ensure the data's accuracy and reliability. Through exploratory data analysis, I used SQL queries to identify key trends, patterns, and correlations, providing insights into industry-wide layoff trends, affected sectors, and impacted regions.</p>

												<h3>Music Store Data Set EDA in MySQL</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In This Project, I worked with a complex dataset consisting of multiple interconnected tables, including Artists, Tracks, TrackID, Genres, and more. Using MySQL, I performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) by applying multiple JOIN operations to combine data across these tables. This allowed me to uncover insights such as the most popular genres, top-performing artists, and the relationship between track sales and genre preferences. Through this approach, I was able to identify trends and correlations.</p>

												<h3>Bike Sales Analysis and Dashboard in Excel</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In This Project, I worked with a dataset containing key customer attributes such as Marital Status, Gender, Income, Car Ownership, and Age, etc. I performed data cleaning to address missing values, inconsistencies, ensuring the dataset was ready for analysis. After cleaning, I created an interactive dashboard in Excel to visualize key trends and metrics, such as sales patterns by demographics and the relationship between income and bike purchases. The dashboard provided clear insights into customer segments and helped identify potential areas for targeted marketing and sales strategies.</p>

												<h3>Data Professionals Survey Analysis and Dashboard in Power BI</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In This Project, I worked with a survey dataset containing columns such as Time Spent, Gender, Income, Current Role, Industry, Favorite Programming Language, Age, and Country. I performed basic data cleaning to handle missing values and inconsistencies, ensuring the dataset was accurate for analysis. Using simple DAX queries in Power BI, I analyzed trends and patterns. Finally, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualized key insights, allowing for easy exploration of survey responses across different demographics and roles.</p>

												<h3>Credit Card Financial Data Dashboard in Power Bi</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In This project, I analyzed a dataset with columns such as Card Category, Occupation, Credit Limit, Interest Gained, Use of Chip, Revenue, and more. I performed data cleaning and transformation to ensure accuracy before diving into the analysis. Using Power BI, I created two interactive dashboards to perform week-on-week analysis of key metrics, including revenue trends, interest gained, and card usage patterns across different customer segments. These dashboards provided valuable insights into customer behavior, credit usage, and revenue growth, helping identify opportunities for targeted marketing and service improvement.</p>
